# Solutions: Moran Process Exercises

```{solution} moran_process:exam_style_1
:label: solution:moran_process:exam_style_1

1. The standard definition of the [Prisoners Dilemma](#def:prisoners-dilemma) is:

$$
M_r = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    R & T\\
    S & P
\end{pmatrix}
$$

with $T > R > P > S$ and $2r > T + S$. In this case we have:

$$R=3a\qquad T=2a \qquad S= \qquad P=2$$

This implies that for $a>0$ we have $T<R$ thus this is not Prisoner's Dilemma.
